Electoral integrity is at stake in a series of states in the wider Eastern Neighborhood.  Domestic election observation organizations play a crucial role in guaranteeing the integrity of elections by monitoring all stages of the so called “electoral cycle” and by providing recommendations for democratic electoral reforms.

In recent years, we have witnessed attempts of politically biased “election observers” to discredit findings of established international and domestic observers and to whitewash fraudulent elections in the region. At the same time, we could observe an increasing pressure on independent citizen observers by authorities who ignored their appeals to reform election processes according to international democratic standards.

Since its establishment in 2012, the European Platform for Democratic Elections (EPDE), a network of 14 citizen election observation organizations working in the EU’s Eastern Partnership countries and the Russian Federation, supports citizen election observers in their advocacy efforts to safeguard democratic elections and the institution of independent domestic election monitoring. EPDE supports the collaboration between domestic citizen observers and established international election observation institutions, such as ODIHR-OSCE and the Council of Europe, to guarantee that transparency and highest methodological standards are applied to support democratic elections in the region. 

Over the past 1.5 years, the EPDE has developed an “Electoral Integrity Database.” This database will promote domestic election experts’ recommendations that seek to strengthen democratic electoral reforms and improve electoral integrity, while denouncing messages of politically biased election observers who discredit findings of established election observation missions and whitewash fraudulent elections or legitimize illegitimate elections. The goal is also to provide the EPDE members with a unique and powerful tool to track democratic electoral reforms in their countries and to reveal mechanisms which endanger democratic processes in the region.  

The database, which is accessible through [EPDE's website](https://db.epde.org/ "EPDE Databases"), consists of two main sections: a) Catalogue of Recommendations on Electoral Reform and b) Database of Politically Biased Election Observers.

The database is intended to be used by election experts and observers as a researchable archive and information source on electoral reform recommendations that have been issued over the last decade. For journalists and decision makers, this database is a valuable tool that can facilitate research on international actors, often members of parliaments and other prominent institutions, who misuse the institution of international observation for their own political interests and interests of authorities who want to cover-up electoral fraud. This database should bring these two issues – recommendations on democratic election reforms and findings on politically biased election observation – to the attention of democratic societies and relevant national and international decision makers.
