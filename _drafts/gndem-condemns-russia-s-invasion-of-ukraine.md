The Russian Federation, without any provocation, right or justification, has invaded Ukraine. This aggression is a violation of the sovereignty of the people of Ukraine, of international law, and of the Charter of the United Nations, which requires that "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity of political independence of any state..."

GNDEM, with more than 250 member organizations in 89 countries and territories, categorically condemns Russia's invasion of Ukraine. All peoples have the right to self-determination and by that right to determine their political status. Ukrainians have exercised that right by freely choosing independence and selecting the present leaders of their government through genuine elections. GNDEM members Civil Network Opora and the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, as well as key international observers, confirmed the credibility of Ukraine's elections. The invasion - if successful - breaches the free expression of the Ukrainian people's will, which stands out clearly for all to see.

GNDEM notes that Russian troops entered Ukraine from Belarus as well as Russia and that Belarus's authoritarian leader has stated that Belarussian country's troops could take part in Russia's invasion. This demonstrated that the invasion is an action of authoritarian states against democratic Ukraine. GNDEM also noted that Russian troops seized the Chernobyl nuclear power station, and the station staff is being held hostage. This threatens the security of not only Ukraine but also a significant part of Europe.

GNDEM expresses its solidarity with Civil Network Opora, the Committee of Voters of Ukraine, and the people of Ukraine, and GNDEM calls on the international community to do everything possible to ensure the sovereignty of the people of Ukraine.
