The Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) condemns the murder of Mohammad Yuosuf Rasheed, the Executive Director of the [Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan (FEFA)](https://www.fefa.org.af/ "Free and Fair Election Forum of Afghanistan"), a GNDEM member organization. Rasheed was a well-known and respected figure among Afghan civil society and the global election integrity community. In his role as Executive Director of FEFA, a non-partisan civil society organization that works to advance Afghan democracy and electoral integrity, Rasheed was a critical voice and valued contributor to the country’s work on democracy and human rights. 

GNDEM joins FEFA, the broader Afghan civil society, and the international community in mourning the loss of a dedicated colleague and extends sympathies to Rasheed’s family and colleagues. We urge the Afghan authorities to do everything in their power to protect those who engage in defending elections and broader democratic processes.
