As the Declaration of Global Principles for Non-Partisan Election Observation and Monitoring By Citizen Organizations (DoGP) acknowledges, genuine democratic elections are the peoples’ expression of sovereignty and a right of citizens. Nonpartisan citizen election monitoring enhances election integrity, promotes public confidence in the legitimacy of results, holds governments accountable, contributes to safeguarding genuine elections and mitigates potential conflicts. For their work promoting democratic and inclusive processes and government accountability as well as protecting civil and political rights, election observers have been recognized as human rights defenders by the [United Nations Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights defenders and on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association](https://srdefenders.org/information/the-situation-of-election-observers-as-human-rights-defenders%ef%bf%bc/ "United Nations Special Rapporteurs on the situation of human rights defenders and on the rights to freedom of peaceful assembly and of association") as well as by the [Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)](https://www.oas.org/en/IACHR/jsForm/?File=/en/iachr/media_center/PReleases/2024/112.asp "Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR)").

However, the rights of election observers have come under growing pressure from authoritarian and semi-authoritarian regimes seeking to limit transparency and stifle criticism of electoral irregularities. In an increasing number of countries, citizen observer groups are facing legal, procedural, operational, and coercive restrictions that hinder or entirely prevent their efforts to promote electoral integrity. 

GNDEM aims to continue to highlight the issue by documenting cases and continuing research on observer rights to better understand the specific and comparative barriers that affect observers’ ability to do their work, similarities and differences within and among regions, and how observers can defend their rights. The documentation and research will inform GNDEM and its regional networks’ advocacy and communications strategies around the protection of observer rights and resource development, as well as serve as a valuable resource for the rest of the elections and democracy community on the challenges to observer rights globally. This page serves as an ongoing compilation of violations of citizen observer rights around the world in 2024, thus far.
