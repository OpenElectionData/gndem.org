The Global Network for Domestic Election Observers (GNDEM) strongly condemns the raid and arbitrary detention of staff and volunteers of the Election Resource Centre (ERC) and the Zimbabwe Electoral Support Network (ZESN). 

On the night of the 2023 harmonised elections, shortly after polls closed and right as the counting of results at polling stations was underway, armed security officials raided the observation data center of ERC and ZESN. Staff and volunteers were rounded up and taken, while additional staff staying at a nearby hotel were also targeted and seized. Data center and office equipment were also confiscated. In total nearly 40 staff and volunteers, most of them young Zimbabweans, have been unlawfully taken and their whereabouts, at the time of this statement, remain unknown. 

ERC and ZESN are independent nonpartisan organizations comprised of principled and diverse civic organizations which have long histories of promoting peaceful elections in Zimbabwe. Both organizations are signatories of the [Declaration of Global Principles for Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations](https://gndem.org/declaration-of-global-principles/) which sets standards for the conduct of observers and underscores the importance of independent, professional and credible election observation. They undertook a sample-based observation to systematically assess the quality of opening, voting, closing and counting processes using publicly available data and their own observations at the polling station. ERC and ZESN are duly registered organizations in the country, and were themselves accredited by the ZEC who was aware of their observation efforts.

This brazen action by the government is a clear violation of the freedom of association and civil rights, and contravenes the rights of observers, recognized as [human rights defenders](https://srdefenders.org/information/the-situation-of-election-observers-as-human-rights-defenders%ef%bf%bc/) by the UN Special Rapporteur. The government’s effective termination of the sample-based observation at a critical point in the electoral process was a clear attempt to limit transparency of the electoral results, and ultimately undermines the credibility of the entire election and its subsequent outcome. 

GNDEM is joining Zimbabwean human rights defenders’ and international election observers’ call for the immediate release of all detained SBO staff and volunteers. GNDEM would also ask the international community and regional bodies to demonstrate support for the rights of Zimbabweans to associate freely as a part of - and in support for - democratic elections.
