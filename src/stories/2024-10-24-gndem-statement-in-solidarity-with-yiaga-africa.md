The Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) stands in solidarity with the citizen election observation organization and GNDEM member Yiaga Africa in Nigeria and condemns efforts to discredit independent nonpartisan citizen election observers. 

For the September 21, 2024 Edo State elections, Yiaga Africa successfully conducted a Process and Results Verification for Transparency (PRVT), a proven methodology to assess the quality of the process and verify that official election results reflect the will of the voters. In their [post-election statement](https://yiaga.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Post-election-Press-Statement-on-2024-Edo-Gov-Election.pdf), Yiaga Africa raised concerns about inconsistencies in the official results released by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). In accordance with the [Declaration of Global Principles for Nonpartisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations](https://gndem.org/declaration-of-global-principles/), Yiaga Africa employs the most systematic and precise methodologies to produce their observation findings and conclusions, as accurately, impartially, and timely as possible. Yiaga Africa has conducted PRVTs in 2 National Elections and 16 Governorship elections in Nigeria, showing its efficiency and preciseness in assessing the quality of election day process, verifying election results and identifying results manipulation when it has occurred. GNDEM stands with Yiaga Africa and has confidence in their methodology.

GNDEM condemns statements issued by political parties and other stakeholders attacking Yiaga Africa and their independent assessment of the process through credible findings. These actions seek to undermine independent, nonpartisan citizen election observation and violate the rights of election observers.[ United Nations Special Rapporteurs have explicitly recognized that election observers, including citizen observers, are human rights defenders](https://srdefenders.org/information/the-situation-of-election-observers-as-human-rights-defenders%EF%BF%BC/). As such, “\[m]ember States are urged to take all necessary steps to establish conditions that allow national and international election observers to effectively do their work, and to protect them from any violence, threats, retaliation, adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of their legitimate exercise of their rights and freedoms.”

GNDEM urges all political parties and election management authorities to take all steps possible to mitigate efforts to intimidate or discredit legitimate nonpartisan election observation and ensure that citizen election observers are able to do their work safely. GNDEM stands in solidarity with Yiaga Africa and all nonpartisan citizen election observers who face attempts to discredit their work or threats against their right to observe elections.
