The [Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM)](https://gndem.org/) expresses its deep concern over the Serbian Police raid of the office of the GNDEM member, the nonpartisan [Center for Research Transparency and Accountability (CRTA)](https://crta.rs/en/), as well as other Serbian civic organizations. GNDEM strongly condemns efforts by the Serbian government to threaten nonpartisan citizen observers as well as broader legitimate civil society and infringe on their civic, political and human rights. GNDEM stands in solidarity with CRTA and other independent Serbian civic organizations and urgently calls upon the Government of Serbia to immediately cease harassing these organizations and to respect the rights of nonpartisan citizen election observers and other civic organizations.

Non-partisan citizen election observers, like CRTA, promote transparency and safeguard election integrity. They are advocates for all citizens’ rights to participate in public affairs and hold institutions accountable. Additionally, citizen observers strive to safeguard the constitutional and human rights of citizens including freedom of assembly and expression.

As United Nations Special Rapporteurs and the European Commission for Democracy through Law (the Venice Commission) declared, nonpartisan citizen election observers are human rights defenders who serve to protect civil and political rights of citizens and that “member states are urged to take all necessary steps to establish conditions that allow national and international election observers to effectively do their work, and to protect them from any violence, threats, retaliation, adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of their legitimate exercise of their rights and freedoms.” GNDEM condemns actions to intimidate election observers and other civic organizations and to limit their capacity to advance democratic values.

GNDEM will continue to support nonpartisan citizen observers in their mission to uphold democratic values in Serbia and stand in solidarity with civic organizations in their efforts to promote full participation, transparency, and accountability in elections and beyond. Serbian authorities must adhere to their responsibility to protect human rights defenders in accordance with international law.
