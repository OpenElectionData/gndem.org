  The Global Network for Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) is proud to release

  first study to document and highlight the global status of nonpartisan citizen
  observer rights, along with the lessons learned and the concerted efforts

The Global Network for Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) is proud to release the first ever “[Report on the Global State of Nonpartisan Citizen Election Observers’ Rights.](https://assets.tina.io/21207727-500d-4af0-9540-7c3b2ae33b1d/State-of-Global-Observer-Rights-Report-2024-FINAL.pdf)” This study, conducted in partnership with the National Democratic Institute ([NDI](https://www.ndi.org/)), draws on the experiences and lessons shared by nonpartisan citizen election monitoring groups worldwide. This research is the first study to document and highlight the global status of nonpartisan citizen observer rights, along with the lessons learned and the concerted efforts needed to ensure that the rights of citizen observers are respected, protected, and promoted. 

While ad hoc efforts have previously been made to track enabling conditions for nonpartisan citizen observation and violations of citizen observer rights, there has not yet been comprehensive research on the topic until now. The report looks at five broad areas affecting the ability of citizen observers to monitor elections: 1) legal recognition as well as legal barriers; 2) procedural and operational barriers; 3) violence, intimidation and coercion against citizen observers; 4) freedom of movement, information and expression; and 5) freedom of association. The findings of this report were drawn from a structured survey with 66 organizations from 53 countries participating, covering every region in the world, and supplemented by 11 key informant interviews of observation experts, civil society leaders and human rights defenders. 

Unfortunately this report comes at challenging times and confirms that nonpartisan citizen election observers are facing new and more extreme efforts to derail their work than ever before. Findings from the report reveal that election monitoring organizations are experiencing heightened levels of violence, intimidation and harassment, often sponsored by the state - [including the recent arrest and detention of GNDEM’s chair](https://gndem.org/stories/gndem-expresses-serious-concern-about-arrest-of-leading-uganda-nonpartisan-citizen-observer-and-gndem-chairperson/). The survey also investigates how accreditation procedures have been used across the globe to undermine the rights of nonpartisan citizen observers. 

The mission and dedication of nonpartisan citizen election observers - [increasingly recognized as ‘specialized human rights defenders’](https://srdefenders.org/information/the-situation-of-election-observers-as-human-rights-defenders%ef%bf%bc/) - will continue despite growing threats. Elections fundamentally belong to citizens and therefore citizens have the right to observe their own election. Citizen observation serves to engage people in democratic life; to make electoral processes more transparent; and to hold not just election management bodies, but candidates and parties accountable. GNDEM hopes that this report is only the first of what will become a series of periodic assessments to identify the trends and tactics used to limit the rights of citizen observers as well as offering insights on how citizen observers (and their allies) can protect and expand their rights.
