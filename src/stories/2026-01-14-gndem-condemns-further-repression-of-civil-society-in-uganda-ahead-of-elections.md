The Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) condemns the escalating crackdown on civic and democratic actors in Uganda ahead of the January 15, 2026 elections. The most recent actions included the [suspension of GNDEM member](https://www.monitor.co.ug/uganda/news/national/govt-suspends-five-rights-groups-ahead-of-elections-5324806) the [Alliance for Finance Monitoring (ACFIM)](https://acfim.org/), as well as other anti-corruption and human rights organizations such as [Chapter Four Uganda](https://chapterfouruganda.org/), [Human Rights Network for Journalists-Uganda (HRNJ-U),](https://hrnjuganda.org/) [National NGO Forum](https://ngoforum.or.ug/), and [National Coalition of Human Rights Defenders](https://hrdcoalition.ug/). These suspensions are a direct attempt to reduce transparency of the upcoming elections and intimidate citizens who may scrutinize the process. Moreover, the government has taken the extreme step to [cut access to the internet](https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/13/world/africa/uganda-election-internet.html) ahead of voting, making it more challenging for civic actors to organize, take safety measures, and communicate updates. These events exacerbate an already oppressive pre-election environment in the country, including the illegal arrest and detention of GNDEM chairperson Dr. Sarah Bireete who [remains in prison](https://gndem.org/stories/gndem-expresses-serious-concern-about-arrest-of-leading-uganda-nonpartisan-citizen-observer-and-gndem-chairperson/) without bail until after the elections. GNDEM continues to call for her immediate release.

These actions further undermine fundamental rights and standards for democratic elections, including the right to freedom of expression and access to information in [Article 19](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2019,media%20and%20regardless%20of%20frontiers.) and the freedom of assembly and association in [Article 20](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights#:~:text=Article%2020,to%20belong%20to%20an%20association.) of the [Universal Declaration of Human Rights](https://www.un.org/en/about-us/universal-declaration-of-human-rights), and [Article 19](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights#article-19) in the [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights). The United Nations General Assembly recognized the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the internet, including condemning internet shutdowns to “intentionally and arbitrarily prevent or disrupt access to or dissemination of information online,” in [Resolution 47/16](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/2022-01/NV-shutdowns-call-for-inputs.pdf) of the Human Rights Council. Electoral watchdogs are protected in the right to participate in public affairs in [General Comment 25](https://www.refworld.org/legal/general/hrc/1996/en/28176) and remain [recognized as human rights defenders](https://srdefenders.org/information/the-situation-of-election-observers-as-human-rights-defenders%ef%bf%bc/) by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs. 

GNDEM emphasizes that politically-motivated arrests and the silencing of civil society, particularly at this critical moment, undermines the credibility of the entire electoral process. We ask for the international community and regional bodies to support the right of Ugandans to associate freely as a part of and in support for democratic elections.
