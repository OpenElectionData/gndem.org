The Global Network of Domestic Election Monitors (GNDEM) condemns the actions of the Russian government that resulted in the citizen observer organization [Golos (“Voice”) ceasing all its activities](https://www.golosinfo.org/en/articles/155495). This erodes the freedoms of Russian citizens and further undermines legitimacy of elections in Russia. Golos’ decision is due to the extreme and longstanding state campaign against civic organizations in order to compromise the fundamental right of Russian citizens to participate in public life. The most recent attack was [the government sentencing Golos co-chair Grigory Melkonyants to five years in prison in May 2025](https://gndem.org/stories/gndem_solidarity_statement_golos_russia_2025/) for organizing the activities of a foreign or international organization considered 'undesirable' in Russia. This ruling came after Melkonyants had been held in pre-trial detention for over two years. 

Golos has been a leading independent nonpartisan election monitoring organization in Russia, providing all citizens with systematic fact-based information and analysis on democratic processes in the country. They carried out their work in line with local laws and international standards for citizen election observation as codified in the “[Declaration of Global Principles for Nonpartisan Election Observation and Monitoring by Citizen Organizations](https://gndem.org/declaration-of-global-principles/).”

Election observation by nonpartisan citizen organizations is an accepted and recognized practice across the globe based on universal rights. Citizen observers serve as essential safeguards to credible elections, promoting transparency and accountability, strengthening civic participation, and building confidence in the democratic process. Legal action against nonpartisan election observers not only intimidates and silences independent voices, but also discredits any elections held under these conditions.

The rights of election observers are duly recognized by the [United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights Defenders](https://srdefenders.org/information/the-situation-of-election-observers-as-human-rights-defenders%ef%bf%bc/), the [European Commission for Democracy through Law (Venice Commission)](https://www.venice.coe.int/webforms/documents/default.aspx?pdffile=CDL-AD\(2024\)039-e) and other regional and international instruments, which affirm that election observers, including nonpartisan citizen election observers, are human rights defenders who serve to protect civil and political rights of citizens. In particular, member countries are “urged to take all necessary steps to establish conditions that allow national and international election observers to effectively do their work, and to protect them from any violence, threats, retaliation, adverse discrimination, pressure or any other arbitrary action as a consequence of their legitimate exercise of their rights and freedoms.”

The GNDEM community stands in solidarity with and supports the work of citizen election observers around the world that are facing unprecedented barriers to their ability to safeguard elections. We ask the international community to join us in condemning the actions of the Russian government that restrict civic space and led to the closing of Golos, as well as to protect human rights defenders in accordance with international law.
